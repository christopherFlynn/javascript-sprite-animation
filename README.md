# javascript-sprite-animation

Project Overview:
Given a sprite sheet and data about that sprite sheet, this program can allow the user to cycle through and view each animation.
HTML, CSS, JS

What I learned:
Basic sprite animation in JS
Setting up Canvas in HTML & JS
Using methods and variables associated with Canvas
Using an array of animationStates to organize animations (prevents hardcoding and keep code flexible)
forEach loop adds each frame location without manual setup if given sprite's width and height
How to use .drawImage(), and possible argument configurations for it
